            <h3>What is the StartLabs community?</h3>
            <p>With over 3,000 people in the greater StartLabs community (Twitter followers, Facebook likes, mailing list members), StartLabs connects MIT undergraduates and alumni to resources on and off campus. StartLabs Community Members are people who aren’t necessarily interested in building out the community from a structural standpoint, but want to come to events and meet other like-minded people.</p>
            <h3>What kind of events can I expect?</h3>
            <p>We host numerous talks by experienced entrepreneurs, info sessions with venture capital firms, a weekly “perpetual hackathon” called Incube, help to organize Boston’s premier cross-campus accelerator, InnovateEDU, sponsor tech treks to places around Boston, the US, and beyond, put on campus-wide celebrations of entrepreneurship, and much, much, more!</p>
            <h3>How do I join the community?</h3>
            Simply join via this form!

            <h3>Why should I join the StartLabs Team?</h3>
            <p>StartLabs team members have the chance to make big changes to the MIT entrepreneurship ecosystem, designing and executing events, seminars, and socials, directly interfacing with top influencers at MIT, Boston, and beyond. You’ll learn a ton, not only from our internal education program, but also by having hands-on experiences of being the backbone of the undergrad population at MIT. You get top priority for participation in TechTreks to New York, San Francisco, Israel, and beyond. Join an amazing community of some of MIT’s brightest and most innovative students. And, did we mention an awesome weekly dinner? </p>
            <h3>What's the commitment for joining the team?</h3>
            <p>StartLabs team members must be willing to commit at least two hours per week (one hour meeting + one hour of work) with the expectation of contributing more. We have weekly all-team meetings, with half an hour of updates and education before jumping into worksessions, always with food. Unsure of joining? You can always join our community.</p>
            <h3>How do I join the team?</h3>
            <p>We currently take about 5 new recruits every semester. Join our community mailing list (or look out for our dorm spam) to receive our application, or check back on this website at the beginning two weeks of every semester</p>
